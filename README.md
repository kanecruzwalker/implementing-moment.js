# implementing-moment.js
Using javascript and jQuery to work with moment.js and store values to local.

This project was created to familiarize myself with moment.js as well as with storing data locally to be called upon refreshing a page.

While moment.js felt like a big learning curver. There is stull much to work on as I am still working out how to set content to local and pull from it. With time this project shall develop into a functioning product.
